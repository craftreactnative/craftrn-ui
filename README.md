## CraftReactNative UI components

Ever felt trapped by rigid development solutions that limit your creativity? **CraftReactNative** breaks that mold.

This isn't just another component library, it's an ecosystem that puts _you_ in control of your mobile app development. Written in TypeScript and built on carefully selected core libraries, CraftReactNative empowers you to build exactly what you envision.

## Why CraftReactNative is Different

Traditional solutions force you to adapt your vision to their constraints. You install a package, import pre-built elements, and then fight against their limitations when customizing.

CraftReactNative flips this model on its head:

- **Copy, paste, customize** - Take only what you need and make it truly yours
- **No dependency lock-in** - Your code, your rules
- **Full creative control** - Modify anything without worrying about breaking updates

## Powered by Unistyles ðŸ¦„

Built around [**Unistyles**](https://github.com/jpudysz/react-native-unistyles) - the revolutionary styling library that's transforming React Native development. Think of Unistyles as TypeScript for your styles: it enhances the familiar StyleSheet API with powerful features like:

- **Type-safe theming** with full TypeScript support
- **Runtime theme switching** for dark/light modes
- **Better performance** than traditional styling approaches
- **Familiar syntax** that feels natural to React Native developers

CraftReactNative components leverage Unistyles' full potential, giving you a styling system that scales from simple apps to complex enterprise solutions.
