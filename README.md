## CraftReactNative UI components

Ever felt trapped by rigid development solutions that limit your creativity? **CraftReactNative** breaks that mold.

This isn't just another component library, it's an ecosystem that puts _you_ in control of your mobile app development. Written in TypeScript and built on carefully selected core libraries, CraftReactNative empowers you to build exactly what you envision.

## Why CraftReactNative is Different

Traditional solutions force you to adapt your vision to their constraints. You install a package, import pre-built elements, and then fight against their limitations when customizing.

CraftReactNative flips this model on its head:

- **Copy, paste, customize** - Take only what you need and make it truly yours
- **No dependency lock-in** - Your code, your rules
- **Full creative control** - Modify anything without worrying about breaking updates

Built around [Unistyles](https://github.com/jpudysz/react-native-unistyles) (a superset of StyleSheet similar to how TypeScript enhances JavaScript), CraftReactNative feels instantly familiar to React Native developers while offering powerful new capabilities.
