![CraftReactNative Logo](https://github.com/craftreactnative/craftrn-ui/raw/main/demo-app/assets/images/craftrn-light.png)

This repository provides reusable UI components for React Native projects. These components are designed to simplify mobile app development and can be easily copied and pasted into your projects. A demo app is included to showcase how to use these components, but the primary focus of this repository is to provide the components themselves.

## Features

- **Ready-to-use Components**: A wide range of UI components built with React Native and TypeScript.
- **Demo App**: A fully functional app to explore and test all components.
- **Copy & Paste**: Easily integrate components into your project by copying the code.
- **Customizable**: Tailor components to fit your app's design and functionality.

## Documentation
